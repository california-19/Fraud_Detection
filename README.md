Detecting fraudulant credit card transactions

This code is to detect fraudulent transactions on credit card purchases. The dataset is availabe at Kaggle.com with the name "creditcard.csv". A PySpark session is used to run this code. I used Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boost and Random Forest classifiers on the same dataset. I got the best accuracy rate with the Random Forest classifier.
